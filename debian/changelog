  * Based on the Ubuntu package for Lucid done by Scott James Remnant with the
    following changes:

    - Use binary:Version instead of Source-Version.
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.4.
    - Add Homepage and Vcs-* fields.
    - Don't symlink /usr/share/doc directories.
    - Refer to versioned /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2 file in
      debian/copyright.
    - List all symbols explicitly instead of using a wildcard and add symbols
      introduced in 1.0.1.
    - Use the symbols files to create the correct version info instead of
      specifying it manually via shlibs.
    - Switch to source format 3.0 (quilt).
    - Add watch file to track new upstream releases.
